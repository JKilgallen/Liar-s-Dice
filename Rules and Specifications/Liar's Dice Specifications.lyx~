\begin_layout Section
Rules of the Game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Liar's dice is a game for two or more players.
 The object of the game is to be the last player with dice.
 Each player begins with 5 dice and a cup.
 At the beginning of each round all players shake their dice in the cup
 and then turn the cup over, being sure to conceal the values of their dice.
 For the first round a randomly selcted player begins by making a bid.
 A bid is a statement about the number of dice of a certain value there
 are collectively i.e.
 including all opponents dice.
 The following player then has three options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They may make a higher bid i.e.
 they claim that there are a higher number of dice of a certain value (which
 is not necessarily the same value as the previous players bid).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They may call the preceding player a liar.
 In this case all players reveal their dice and should there be less than
 the number of dice the preceding player bid then that player loses a die.
 However, Should there be the same number bid, or more, then the player
 who challenged the bid loses a die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player could alternatively say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Spot on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this case as well all players reveal their dice.
 However, if the preceding players bid happens to be exactly the case then
 the challenging player can either; reclaim a lost die, or force the previous
 player to lose two dice.
 Should the bid happen to be false i.e.
 there were more or less dice of a certain value bid then the challenging
 player loses a die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a challenge is made the round ends and a new round begins, and the
 player to the left of the loser of the challenge begins the next round.
 This continues until only one player has dice remaining.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there are a couple of extra rules involving sixes.
 A die with a value of six is 
\emph on
wild
\emph default
 and can take on any value.
 For instance if a player made a bid that there were five dice with value
 of three on the table, and the following player challenged, then if there
 were four threes and three sixes, then we would say there are seven threes
 on the table.
 Consequently, to account for how much less likely there are to be a certain
 number of sixes on the table than the same number of another value, sixes
 are worth double for the purposes of bidding.
 For example if a player bid three fives, then the following player could
 bid two sixes as the value of two sixes is four.
 Alternatively if a player bid two sixes then the following player would
 need to bid seven of another value, or three sixes.

\begin_layout Standard
The games will be simulated using a python script which implements the rules
 outlined in the previous section.
 The only shared data structure available to players is the bids object.
 This contains all of the bids from players in the current round.
 The game playing AIs submitted will need to inheret from the Player class.
 This interface defines a single method called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

move
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which takes the bids data structure, and the values of the current players
 dice as arguments and returns a string representing the next move.
 The return value must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Liar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Spot on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or a valid bid of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a,b
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.

Competition Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The competition parameters i.e.
 number of games, method of scoring, number of players per game, time limit
 per move etc.
 will be determined once all participants have signed up.
 I'm very open to any suggestions people have about what the fairest way
 in which to implement this is.
